  </span>
</h3>
[Focus for YouTube](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/focus-for-youtube/id1514703160?mt=12) enables users to streamline their video browsing experience. Whether you work on YouTube and are tired of the distractions, or whether you're a teacher who'd rather keep their recommended videos private while screencasting, you'll be able to fix YouTube to your liking within the Focus app. Since Focus disables the loading of many thumbnails, it will also speed up your browsing.

  </span>
</h3>
[Transcript Reader](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/transcript-reader/id1595490573) extends the concept of Safari's default "reader mode" beyond the domain of articles and into subtitles. It's great for students who want to be able to select, copy, or Quick Note portions of a lecture, people who have trouble focusing on the content of a video (such as those with ADHD), or those who have trouble reading subtitles. If you have ADHD, a visual or hearing impairment, or another accessibility need, please email shockerellaapps@gmail.com for 100% off (no questions asked).

Tired of seeing Oculus, Townhall, and Marketplace? [Simplifier for Facebook](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/simplifier-for-facebook/id1509832815?mt=12) is a browser extension that enables users to streamline Facebook's cluttered UI.

## Get Involved

Appccessibility Shox is currently recruiting members of the disabled community to join a review panel to provide the ideas and feedback that will drive future initiatives. No coding ability is required. The review panel will be an unpaid position that meets virtually from 7:00-8:30 PM EST on the first Sunday of every third month with the next meeting being on November 7, 2021. The time commitment is very flexible, though, and we will be respectful of your time. As a member, you also get free access to all of Appccessibility Shox’s apps. If this sounds like something you would be interested in, **please** reach out to shockerellaapps@gmail.com.
Additionally, non-disabled people can reach out to discuss other ways to get involved based on skillset.
